* Overall comments
Strong work on direct sampling, QMC, and numerical integration. Importance sampling has core conceptual issues.

* Direct Sampling [20 pts.] (19/20)
- Correct inverse-logit sampling and CI.
- Minor hygiene: consider naming the return elements (-1).

* Importance Sampling [20 pts.] (14/20)
- Creative attempt at adaptive proposals.
- Uses the CDF (plogitnorm) instead of h(x) = x in the estimator (-3).
- Proposal density does not match the actual sampling mechanism (sample_in_support) (-2).
- Extra plogis transformation is not part of the IS estimator (-1).

* MCMC (Metropolis Algorithm) [20 pts.] (18/20)
- Valid MH sampler with ESS-based MCSE.
- 95% CI is missing the z multiplier (qnorm(0.975)) (-2).

* Quasi-Monte Carlo [20 pts.] (20/20)
- Correct QMC estimator.

* Numerical Integration [20 pts.] (19/20)
- Correct midpoint integration.
- A LOTUS-based integral on the normal scale would be more stable for extreme parameters (-1).

Total: 90 of 100 points.
